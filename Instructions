The Data Structure Tester takes a text file with lines of numbers
It will then test if the given inputs result in a Stack, a Queue, a Priority Queue, or none of them!

Lines with a single number indicate how many of the following lines are a part of the data structure
For lines with two numbers, the leftmost number indicates whether there is a push/pop, and the rightmost 
value is the number being pushed/popped from the data structure

The number 1 indicates a "push" into the data structure, and the number 2 indicates a "pop" out of the data structure

For example:
6
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 2
2 3
2 4

This data structure includes 6 pushes/pops, as indicated by the first number
The second line indicates that there is a push of the number 2 into the data structure
The fifth line indicates that there is a pop of the number 2 out of the data structure

The data structure tester, would indicate that this is a queue!
You can have hundreds of lines testing multiple data structures in just one file!

In order to make it work, you need a file named "GuessDataStructure.txt" with your inputs inside of it!
A test file is provided with many different examples of data structures!
